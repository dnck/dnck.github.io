<p>I’m a <strong>pragmatic</strong>, <strong>technologically-oriented, cognitive scientist</strong> deeply involved in <strong>distributed systems</strong> and <strong>networks</strong>. I have several years experience as a <strong>Python programmer and developer</strong> where I prefer to write object oriented programs. I can read and write in several other languages including <strong>Javascript</strong> (nodejs) and <strong>Java</strong>. This website was created with a variety of different tools, including <strong>ruby, git, html, css, sass, and js</strong>.</p>

<p>My undergraduate training as an <strong>analytic philosopher</strong> (2005-2008) led me to study the <strong>embodied, extended, and enactive approaches to cognition</strong> as a graduate student at the University of Central Florida (2009-2011) and at King’s College, London. After working in NYC for some time, I ended up at the Berlin School of Mind and Brain (2014-2017) where I studied again <strong>computational cognitive science</strong> and I wrote my master’s thesis on <strong>recursion in vision and language</strong>. While there, I also interned in the <strong>machine learning</strong> department of the Fraunhofer Institute, and I worked as a <strong>scientific editor</strong> for the <strong>open-access</strong> journal, ScienceOpen Research.</p>

<p>Inspired by the similarities between the way in which the human mind is organized into a collection of cooperative, independent modules and peer-to-peer networks, after my Master’s degree, I took up work at a <strong>software company</strong> where <strong>I developed a modeling and simulation pipeline</strong> of a network architecture. The goal of the simulation was to show how various <strong>protocols</strong> should interface with one another in an end-to-end network architecture in order to realize a  <strong>permissionless, totally decentralized, distributed ledger</strong> in a <strong>safe and efficient</strong> manner.</p>

<p>Lately, I’ve been getting into the idea of <strong>test-driven software development</strong>, and more and more, I’m believing that <strong>the only things worth thinking about are data structures &amp; algorithms * visualization</strong>. I don’t really have too much time for blogging and website design, but from time to time, I update this site in my free time.</p>
