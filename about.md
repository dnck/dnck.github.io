I'm a **pragmatic**, **technologically-oriented, cognitive scientist** deeply involved in **distributed systems** and **networks**. I have several years experience as a **Python programmer and developer** where I prefer to write object oriented programs. I can read and write in several other languages including **Javascript** (nodejs) and **Java**. This website was created with a variety of different tools, including **ruby, git, html, css, sass, and js**.

My undergraduate training as an **analytic philosopher** (2005-2008) led me to study the **embodied, extended, and enactive approaches to cognition** as a graduate student at the University of Central Florida (2009-2011) and at King's College, London. After working in NYC for some time, I ended up at the Berlin School of Mind and Brain (2014-2017) where I studied again **computational cognitive science** and I wrote my master's thesis on **recursion in vision and language**. While there, I also interned in the **machine learning** department of the Fraunhofer Institute, and I worked as a **scientific editor** for the **open-access** journal, ScienceOpen Research.  

Inspired by the similarities between the way in which the human mind is organized into a collection of cooperative, independent modules and peer-to-peer networks, after my Master's degree, I took up work at a **software company** where **I developed a modeling and simulation pipeline** of a network architecture. The goal of the simulation was to show how various **protocols** should interface with one another in an end-to-end network architecture in order to realize a  **permissionless, totally decentralized, distributed ledger** in a **safe and efficient** manner.

Lately, I've been getting into the idea of **test-driven software development**, and more and more, I'm believing that **the only things worth thinking about are data structures & algorithms * visualization**. I don't really have too much time for blogging and website design, but from time to time, I update this site in my free time.
