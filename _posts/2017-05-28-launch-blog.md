I'm launching my new personal blog/website today for three reasons.

First, I want to learn how the web framework underlying the blog works. Second, I want to write regularly on things that inspire me. Third, I think that most ideas need to be structured by alternative perspectives before they're ready for public consumption. With the blog, I'm hoping to solicit feedback on some of my private ideas.

I plan to share two blog posts today. I also have a list of future blog posts planned out. As things might change, there are three themes that unite my blog. Those themes are a) cognitive science and language, 2) computer science and math, and 3) personal stuff with some code thrown in.

Thanks for reading.

Dan
