excerpt: All about me!
---

I'm a pragmatic, technologically-oriented, cognitive scientist working on computer networks and distributed systems.

Inspired by the similarities between the way in which the human mind is organized into a collection of cooperative, independent modules and peer-to-peer networks, after my Master's degree in cognitive neuroscience, I took employment at a software company where I developed a modeling and simulation pipeline of a network architecture. The goal of the simulation was to make the interfaces of the system architecture explicit for modification. After working on this project, I took an employment position working as a DevOps Engineer. Now, I spend most of my work days thinking about data structures & algorithms. I don't really have too much time for blogging and website design, but from time to time, I update this site in my free time.
