I'm a pragmatic, technologically-oriented, cognitive scientist working on computer networks and distributed systems.

I did an undergraduate degree in philosophy (2005-2008), which led me to study the embodied, extended, and enactive approaches to cognition as a graduate student at the University of Central Florida (2009-2011) and at King's College, London.

After working in NYC for some time, I ended up at the Berlin School of Mind and Brain (2014-2017) where I studied again computational cognitive science and I wrote my master's thesis on recursion in vision and language. While there, I also interned in the machine learning department of the Fraunhofer Institute, and I worked as a scientific editor for the open-access journal, ScienceOpen Research.  

Inspired by the similarities between the way in which the human mind is organized into a collection of cooperative, independent modules and peer-to-peer networks, after my Master's degree, I took up work at a software company where I developed a modeling and simulation pipeline of a network architecture. The goal of the simulation was to make the interfaces of the system architecture explicit for modification. After working on this project, I took an employment position working as a DevOps Engineer. Now, I spend most of my work days thinking about data structures & algorithms. I don't really have too much time for blogging and website design, but from time to time, I update this site in my free time.
