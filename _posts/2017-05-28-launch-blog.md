excerpt: All about me!
---

I'm a pragmatic cognitive scientist turned software-developer,
turned devops-engineer, working on computer networks and distributed
systems.

Inspired by the similarities between the way in which the human mind
is organized into a collection of cooperative, independent modules
and peer-to-peer networks, after my Master's degree in cognitive
science, I worked at a software company on consensus algorithms in
peer-to-peer networks. After that, I found myself doing a lot of
devops related tasks, like making black-boxes more open, and caring
for the entire software development life cycle.
