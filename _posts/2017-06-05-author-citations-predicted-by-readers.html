You can download the simulated data for the plot below <a href ="{{site.rawgitfiles}}/data/test.csv" download> here</a>. You can play with the code for the plot <a href="https://codepen.io/Cookdj0128/pen/vZNQVx"> at codepen.io.</a>

Each data point represents a research article from a particular author and shows 1) how many times it was read and 2) how many authors have cited the selected article in their own work.

I didn't have access to the real data at the time, so I simulated it from my knowledge of the scienceopen.com corpus.

Single articles on scienceopen have a read-count and a cited-by count. You can see an example of summary statistics<a href ="https://www.scienceopen.com/search#author/ea42759d-c9a9-4bb0-8437-fa41d099df45"> here</a>.

On scienceopen at least, read-counts seem to stand in a one-to-one relationship with the number of times a link to an article was clicked. Also, cited-by counts are gathered by counting how many articles have cited the selected article. Thus, the read-counts and cited-by-counts are useful metrics we can use to evaluate the popularity of a paper.

Here's the code for the simulated data:<br>


```
import numpy as np
read_count = [int(np.random.lognormal(mean=4)) for i in range(140)]
citation_count = [int(np.random.lognormal(mean=4)) for i in range(140)]
```

After running those three lines in an interactive python session, I copied and pasted the values for the variables into two columns of an spreadsheet and I used this as my simulated data. The csv is available for download <a href ='{{site.rawgitfiles}}/data/test.csv' download>here</a>.

Note that I used a lognormal distribution because I noticed that similar summary statistics maintained by Google Scholar looked a lot like they came from a exponential distribtion. I know that's not too scientific, but, this was more of an excercise in visualization, not data science, which I accomplished: I learned how to use plotly and I challenged myself to write code in javascript. As a side-benefit, I learned something about the lognormal distribution, which is worth sharing now.

A distribution is defined as lognormal if it can be mathematically transformed into a gaussian distribution by iteratively applying a log function to each data point in the sample.

The numpy function np.random.lognormal() takes three parameters:
1) the underlying mean of a normal distribution
2) the standard deviation of the underlying normal distribution
3) and the array shape.

Anyway, that's all for now. In future posts, I'll be writing more about my research of research articles, culture, textual analytics, semantics, and the cognition of language.
