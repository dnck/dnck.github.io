A utility function in Python is a small, reusable piece of code that performs a specific task or operation. Utility functions are typically created to simplify common tasks within a program or to encapsulate functionality that can be used across different parts of a program. They are often designed to be generic and can accept input arguments and return values.

Here are some characteristics of utility functions:

1. **Reusability:** Utility functions are designed to be used in multiple places within a program. By encapsulating a specific task in a function, you can avoid duplicating code and make your codebase more maintainable.

2. **Abstraction:** Utility functions abstract away the implementation details of a particular task. This allows you to use the function without needing to know how it accomplishes its task internally.

3. **Modularity:** Utility functions contribute to the modularity of your code. They break down complex tasks into smaller, manageable units, making your code easier to understand and maintain.

4. **Readability:** By giving meaningful names to utility functions, you can improve the readability of your code. Other developers (including your future self) can quickly understand what a function does based on its name.

Here's a simple example of a utility function in Python:

```python
def add_numbers(a, b):
    """A utility function to add two numbers."""
    return a + b

result = add_numbers(5, 3)
print(result)  # Output: 8
```

In this example, `add_numbers` is a utility function that takes two arguments (`a` and `b`) and returns their sum. This function can be used wherever you need to add two numbers in your code, providing a clear and reusable way to perform the addition operation.

Utility functions are an essential part of writing clean, maintainable, and organized code in Python and other programming languages.
